Shamrock Toolbox
================

![Shaman Toolbox Icon](icon.png)

A World of Warcraft Retail PVE Restoration Shaman Toolbox packed as an addon.

Currently it's more or less a buff tracker.

It keeps track of the following buffs:

- [Earth Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=974/earth-shield)
- [Earthliving Weapon](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=382021/earthliving-weapon)
- [Water Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=79949/water-shield)

## Known Issues

- Talents are only fetched on load / reload (so you have to `/reload` after talent change)
- Somehow PVE oriented, it assumes you want Water Shield on you at all times.
